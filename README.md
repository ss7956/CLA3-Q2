Let  be defined as the sum of proper divisors of  (numbers less than  which divide evenly into ).
If  and , where , then  and  are an amicable pair and each of  and  are called amicable numbers.

For example, the proper divisors of  are  therefore . The proper divisors of  are  so .

Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under .
